## Overview

### The challenge

I've been a developer for many years but I've not written any HTML or CSS for a (very) long time. Inevitably, building for the web has changed radically - no more floated layouts for a start! I've decided to go back to basics so I'm doing beginner's tutorials and this is my first effort.

I don't know if it'll be a good idea but I'm going to update this readme as I go along so I have a record of my thinking at each stage. Naturally, I only just thought of this and I'm several commits in but hey ho!

The provided style guide is a lot more sparse than I'd normally like but I've decided to take that as leeway to interpret some aspects with my own preferences.

(From the readme template)
Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [The Picalilli CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)

### What I learned

I don't know what CSS needs to be reset any more! I don't even know if it's really necessary these days but a little digging suggests it's still a good idea. Since it's so subjective, could take me hours to investigate and I only need some basics for this exercise I've taken the simple option and used Andy Bell's reset on face value.

### Continued development

I need to do some more reading around when to use grid and when to use flexbox.
